Understanding Escrow
======================

Once a card is successfully charged your funds are implicitly in escrow for
your marketplace. This gives you complete control on funds disbursement.

You may choose to keep the money in escrow for as long as you desire
- but the common use case for this is to wait for any type of fulfillment
from your merchants -- such as confirmation of a shipped product or
completion of a service.

Since :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>` delivers funds to your merchant within
one (1) business day, you can get a bit more creative as well. For example,
you may stagger the funds for disbursement at different times during the order
process - for example:

- A buyer has paid for a service
- Your merchant needs half of the payout amount as working capital
- You issue 50% of the amount you charged the buyer as a credit to the merchant
  using :ref:`Balanced Payouts <payouts>`
- The merchant performs the service and buyer is happy with the service
- You can pay the other half post completion of the service

In today's growing collaborative consumption economy, this model is extremely
powerful for providing marketplace liquidity to enable new forms of commerce.
