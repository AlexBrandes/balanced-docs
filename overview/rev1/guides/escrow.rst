Understanding Escrow
======================

Every marketplace has a single escrow. This escrow account is essentially like a
pool of funds. Debits bring funds into the marketplace escrow. Credits take
funds out of the marketplace escrow.

Marketplaces have complete control over how funds are dispersed from escrow.
Funds in escrow may be distributed to recipients as desired. There is inherently
no time limit for the duration funds may sit in escrow. Best practice is to
refrain from releasing funds until after merchant fulfillment has occurred,
confirmation of a shipped product or completion of a service for example. Escrow
is not meant as a means of extended withholding. Holding funds in escrow for
extended periods of time often leads to an increased number in chargebacks and
customer dissatisfaction.
