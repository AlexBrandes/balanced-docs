Overview

.. container:: overview-large

  Balanced is a payments company that enables entrepreneurs and developers
  to create new and amazing e-commerce experiences. We’ve built a
  white-labeled API and web-based dashboard to help them do this.
  Specifically, we offer two products: Balanced Payouts and Balanced
  Processing, which can be coupled. We really like working with
  marketplaces and crowd-funding platforms, but Balanced can be used for
  any type of e-commerce model. You should use Balanced to charge your
  buyers’ credit cards and/or pay out to your sellers’ US-based bank
  accounts via `ACH`_.

  We’ve been processing live transactions since October, 2010 and have a
  history of working closely with our customers to solve their problems,
  specifically those related to multi-party transactions. For example,
  we’re in an `open partnership`_ with `Gittip`_ after volunteering code
  and expertise to help them `mitigate the risks of running a
  marketplace`_. To date, Balanced has contributed to Gittip’s `payments
  infrastructure`_, `visual design`_, and `fraud preventions systems`_.

  Balanced believes in openness and transparency, so, despite being a
  payments company, we try to discuss as much of our product development
  decisions in public as possible. We’ve even `discussed pricing
  decisions`_ publicly with our customers.

.. _overview.use_cases:

Use Cases
---------

- **Marketplaces**

  Balanced is most often used to power payments for online and mobile
  marketplaces -- any platform facilitating payments between buyers and
  sellers. For example, `kitchit`_, `copious`_, `zaarly`_, `visual.ly`_,
  and many others are connecting Balanced Processing and Balanced Payouts
  to charge a buyer’s credit card on behalf of a seller.

  Some customers have even implemented a shopping cart checkout flow where
  a single buyer can buy from many sellers with a single transaction. And
  holding the funds with Balanced between Payouts and Processing can allow
  the marketplace to implement an escrow-like functionality.

- **Crowd-funding**

  Balanced is commonly used to power payments for crowd-funding and group
  purchasing platforms. For example, `crowdtilt`_, `wanderable`_,
  `gittip`_, and many others are connecting Balanced Processing and
  Balanced Payouts to charge many buyers’ credit cards on behalf of a
  single seller.

- **Vendor Payments**

  Balanced Payouts is used by many businesses that need to pay their
  sellers or vendors for supplies and services rendered.

- **E-Commerce**

  Balanced Processing is used by a merchants to simply charge buyers for
  items they sell directly.
