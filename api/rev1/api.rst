Balanced API Documentation
==========================

Welcome to the documentation for the Balanced API! Balanced's API is a REST API
based on the `JSON API <http://jsonapi.org>`_ specification. All of the details
are re-explained here, but if you've used other JSON APIs, you will find it
familiar.

There are two ways to browse our documentation. The sidebar on the left
contains API level documentation, which explains the specifics of the various
entities and how to interact with them. In the upper left part of the page, there
is a drop-down menu, from which you can choose the 'Overview', which contains
long-form, guides style documentation. That menu also contains a link to the FAQ.

If you're not sure where to start, the `Getting Started Guide
<../overview/getting-started/>`_ is a good place.
